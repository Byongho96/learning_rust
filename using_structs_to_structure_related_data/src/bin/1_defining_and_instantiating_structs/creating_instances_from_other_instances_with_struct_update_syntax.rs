        // In this example, we can no longer use user1 as a whole after creating user2
        // Because the String in the username field of user1 was moved into user2.
        // We can still use user1.email, user1.active, and user1.sign_in_count, though.

        // If we had given user2 new String values for both email and username, and thus only used the active and sign_in_count values from user1
        // Then user1 would still be valid after creating user2.
        // Wow..
